## Project Requirements
Your app must:

* **Use Mongo & Express** to build an API and a front-end that consumes it
* **Create an API using at least 2 models**, one of which should be a user
* Include **all major CRUD functions** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those model
* **Consume your own API** by making your front-end with HTML, Javascript, & jQuery
* **Add authentication to your API** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard Git flow on Github
* Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible


---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project

## Build

### Technologies 
Using BCrypt with JSON Web Tokens for authentication
Node.js with Express and MongoDB/Mongoose
Google Maps Javascript API, Google Maps Directions Service API
Bower to manage client-side dependencies (Bootstrap, Underscore for templates)
AJAX
Mocha, Chai for testing; Istanbul for test coverage reporting

### Installation Instructions
We're using Node.js with MondoDB on the server-side. Run `npm install ` and include `express`, `mongoose`, `bcrypt`, `body-parser`, `morgan` and any other dependencies that aren't installed globally.

## Unsolved Problems
